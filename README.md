## Vaccine-scheduler-database
This project is a project I did in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at University of Washington. It utilizes Java, SQL,(JDBC)and Microsoft Azure to create a database specifically to vaccine caregiver and patients.
A reservation system is a very common type of database application. It utilizes the E/R diagram to create table statements between patients, caregiver and hospitals. Once we have our relational diagram, we could weave in each input of our database system created with Java.
